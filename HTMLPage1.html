                    Modern design is an interior design style characterized by a monochromatic color palette, clean lines, minimalism, natural materials, and natural light.
                    It refers specifically to a historical aesthetic movement that took place during the early to mid-twentieth century.
                    Though it is often confused—or used interchangeably—with the term "contemporary design," modern design is its own distinct style.

                Bohemian styles are defined by a lack of structure, opting instead for carefree layers of pattern, texture, and color.
                While there are some common practices with the bohemian look, there are no hard and fast rules like there are with modern or minimalist.
                The core of the bohemian aesthetic is that it’s personal and relaxed. Boho styles are not styled for any other person’s enjoyment but your own.

                Rustic interiors are defined by ruggedness and letting natural beauty shine.
                The focus is to create a relaxing atmosphere by highlighting the use of wood, stone, leaves, and other organic elements.
                Rather than worry about perfect lines, rustic allows the character of each piece to stand out.
                From knots in the wood to rust on metal, this style celebrates character in a big way.
